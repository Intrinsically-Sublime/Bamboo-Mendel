---Description---

The idea

Make RepRap more accessible to those without 3D printing technology already

Goals

1) Minimal unique piece count to allow for production from molds.

2) Parts available world wide.

3) Modular for multiple configurations.

Outcome

1) Only eight unique pieces.

2)a Frame made can be made from: Bamboo, Conduit, tubing, pipe, ...
b Tapered holes for Z axis guides for metric or imperial materials.
c No critical bolt sizes.
d Uses (wire rope / aircraft cable / fishing wire) instead of belts.

3) see pictures and continue reading.

Color code for renderings

Yellow = Bamboo/conduit/tubing/etc.
White = Printed or molded parts.
Black = Metal parts.
Red = Aircraft cable/fishing wire/wire rope
Green = Sheet material. (plywood/plexiglass/...)

Additional benefits

A) If printed from PLA and made from bamboo most of it can be composted.

B) You can grow the frame in most habitable parts of the world.

C) Can be built larger scale for producing furniture and larger items using a frostruder and earth based pastes.

D) As Twotimes pointed out if you use thingiverse.com/thing:4439 it will be almost entirely printable

Updates

Dec 27/10 Added Vertex_2.stl Easier to scale and make molds of.
thingiverse.com/thing:5318

Dec 27/10 The original files were scaled wrong and needed to be scaled by 1.333. All the files have been replaced. 

---Instructions---

I will add instruction at some point but for now just a little on how it should work.

All axis are geared down using herringbone gears for high torque to overcome friction. Currently using Rhys-Jones Herringbones gears from thing thingiverse.com/thing:5111

The Aircraft cable is wrapped around the Z axis axle for maximum torque and highest resolution. While it is wrapped around drums on the X and Y axis for higher speeds while still being geared down for torque. I believe two to three wraps around the axle and/or drum should provide adequate gripe as long as the springs used to keep the tension are very strong.

It currently uses prusa style bushing for the guides.
For longer lasting bushings use thingiverse.com/thing:4501 with bronze bushings in them similar to these princessauto.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/3872025.jpg

The vertexes. (should be made parameterized)
They are currently modeled for 20mm id bamboo. They have a tapered hole for the Z axis rod which will allow for slight scaling without any issues. The holes for the axles are 8.5mm and will require modifying/drilling if scaled much. They are designed to expand inside of the hollow material when a screw or lag bolt is screwed in.

I am aware this will be a little hard to assemble square and true due to the lack of adjustment, but possible. It will require shims etc.

Hopefully everything works as designed but even if it doesn't maybe it will inspire others.
